# PHP-web-site

I used PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Bootstrap.

--> This is a Q&A website that you can ask question and make a comment.
--> CKEditor included.
--> You can find SQL file in the project.

To run website you have to config <b>"ayar.php"<b> inside <b>"sistem"<b> folder.

Also you have to change SQL file according to your domain.(If you use localhost like me, you don't need to change anything inside SQL file.)
